# Felix - World Development

## What is this project?

Despite what it (hopefully) looks like, I have no idea what I'm doing with Python. So this project is down to you.

I will provide data and some suggestions of where to start, but I want you to look at the data, understand what it means, and keep developing the project. And of course, you can find your own data, and/or completely ignore any guidance.

Remember, it would be great to have you show the rest of the group your work (this includes what goes wrong) so try and keep some form of document with the best and worst bits.

For you, I have found [data on World Development](/development-indicators.csv). This is a lot of data, so I would start small and build up to a larger project.

## Starting places

As a suggestion, I would start with one `series name` and try and understand what is actually in the dataset and practice getting data out of it. This could be as simple as finding how many countries have data on their CO2 emissions.

Now you have some understanding of what's in the dataset, try plotting one set of data for one country over a year. Then, adding more countries should be an easy extension.

There are a lot of countries though. So maybe think about plotting the most populous countries, or the ones with the most extreme data.

Once you have this, why don't you think about plotting it against the world map (we've done all this before). How can you show statistics of this scale in a way that means something?

What other datasets could you use? I got this one from [the world bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/) but see what you can find and keep working with the data.
