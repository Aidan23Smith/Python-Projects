# Millie - Film and the Oscars

## What is this project?

Despite what it (hopefully) looks like, I have no idea what I'm doing with Python. So this project is down to you.

I will provide data and some suggestions of where to start, but I want you to look at the data, understand what it means, and keep developing the project. And of course, you can find your own data, and/or completely ignore any guidance.

Remember, it would be great to have you show the rest of the group your work (this includes what goes wrong) so try and keep some form of document with the best and worst bits.

For you, I have found data on [films](IMDb_movies.csv), their [ratings](IMDb_ratings.csv), and [the Oscars](the_oscar_award.csv). This is a lot of data, so I would start small and build up to a larger project.

## Starting places

As a suggestion, I would start with one dataset and try to understand what is actually in there, and practice getting data out of it. This could be as simple as finding how many Oscars are awarded per year, or how many films are produced each year.

Now you have some understanding of what's in the datasets, consider how you can link the datasets. What type of merge do you want? What insights are you trying to get out of the data?

With a larger dataset, what statistics can you work out? For example, you could think about average ratings of films per year, or per country.

There is so much you can do with this data, so just think about something you might want to consider, and see what you can create (remember, diagrams are always the best way to show statistics).

Finally, is there any other data which might be useful? These are just a few datasets, but there are many more which could bring further insights.
