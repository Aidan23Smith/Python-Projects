# April - Theatre

## What is this project?

Despite what it (hopefully) looks like, I have no idea what I'm doing with Python. So this project is down to you.

I will provide data and some suggestions of where to start, but I want you to look at the data, understand what it means, and keep developing the project. And of course, you can find your own data, and/or completely ignore any guidance.

Remember, it would be great to have you show the rest of the group your work (this includes what goes wrong) so try and keep some form of document with the best and worst bits.

For you, I have found [data on Broadway theatre](/broadway.csv). This is a lot of data, so I would start small and build up to a larger project.

## Starting places

As a suggestion, I would start with year and try to understand what is actually in the dataset, and practice getting data out of it. This could be as simple as finding how many plays were put on in one particular year.

Now you have some understanding of what's in the dataset, consider what statistics you can find out about it. For example, how many times each play is shown, the total number of attendees, etc.. Remember, the best way to show a statistics is in a diagram.

There are many ways to get information out of the dataset. You could plot the data by data, play, or even location. So have a play around with it, see what you can produce.

Remember, this is just a suggestion of where to start, you can find other datasets (for example, the location of the theatres - although I've struggled to find this information in one place). So have a look around, what data could enhance your findings?
