# Manny - Premier League

## What is this project?

Despite what it (hopefully) looks like, I have no idea what I'm doing with Python. So this project is down to you.

I will provide data and some suggestions of where to start, but I want you to look at the data, understand what it means, and keep developing the project. And of course, you can find your own data, and/or completely ignore any guidance.

Remember, it would be great to have you show the rest of the group your work (this includes what goes wrong) so try and keep some form of document with the best and worst bits.

For you, I have found [data on the Premier League](https://github.com/footballcsv/england). This is a lot of data, so I would start small and build up to a larger project.

## Starting places

As a suggestion, I would start with one year and try and understand what is actually in the dataset and practice getting data out of it. This could be as simple as counting how many times Arsenal played that year (or for one dataset).

From here, you can start merging the data to get a better view of a whole year.

Now you have put a year's worth of data. What insights can you make? Can you figure out Arsenal's stats? Were they better home, or away? Just play around with this to see what stats you can figure out (remember, diagrams are always the best way to show stats).

What about all the data? What happens if you merge every year? Can you get new stats? What about using the old stats and displaying them in a time dependent way?

Now, just carry on working the data. What insights can you find? Is there any data you could find a merge with this set?
